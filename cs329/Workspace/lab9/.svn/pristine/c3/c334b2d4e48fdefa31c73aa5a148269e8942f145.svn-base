We have no shared variables in our code, the only variable that can be edited
from a separate class is the instance variable shutdown_ in the JokeServer class.
There is no concern about a race condition with the shutdown variable because it can only 
be adjusted by the shutdown client and the shutdown method sets the shutdown_ variable to
false no matter what the current value is, this means that there will not be any confusion 
about the variables value even if multiole clients are connecting at the same time.
