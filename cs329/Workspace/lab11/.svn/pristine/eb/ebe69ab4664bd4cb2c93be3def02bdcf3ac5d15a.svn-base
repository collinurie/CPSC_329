Shared Variables: 
	
	open_ - different threads could try to open the door. This could result
			in it being opened or closed when it is supposed to do the opposite. 
	up_ - this value is set in both up() and down() and can be called from several threads
			at a time so this variable needs protection. 
	floor_ - this value can be altered in both the up and down methods and those can be 
				be called at the same time from different threads. 
	
Shared Objects: 
	Elevator  - the passenger_ object within elevator is used within the elevator class which is used in
					multiple threads and can be be assigned different values in those
					different threads. 
	Building - the same Building Object is passed to both Simulation classes which arecreated
				and run as several different threads.
