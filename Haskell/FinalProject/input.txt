Sorabji's counterpoint stems from Busoni's and Reger's; writers  

     have described it as more successful than that of the latter. The 

     influence of these composers led Sorabji to employ various baroque 

     contrapuntal forms (chorale prelude, passacaglia, fugue and others), 

     but he rejected the symmetry and forms that characterise the music of 

     composers such as Mozart and Brahms. Sorabji was dismissive of the 

     Classical style, mainly because he saw it as restricting the musical 

     material to conform to a "ready-made mould", and his musical thinking 

     is closer to that of the Baroque era than to the Classical.

         Ornamentation assumes a preeminent role in much of Sorabji's 

     music. His harmonic language, which frequently combines tonal and 

     atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other 

     composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century 

     composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone 

     relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for 

     example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points 

     in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have 

     remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly

     associated with very dissonant music.
